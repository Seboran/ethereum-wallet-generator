# ethereum-wallet-generator

This application lets you create a private key / ethereum address pair with custom suffix and prefix. [You can try app yourself](https://ethereum-wallet-generator.herokuapp.com/)

Every generated address can be used in the ethereum blockchain, but please du not use them.

## Why ?

This app shows that it is easy to create an ethereum address that almost looks like another ethereum address. Take these two ethereum address :

```
0x935d442b8d998e478279e47edd7d1dbabf920000
0xadfce6b775ab236c46f16bf3a3476612a3dc0000
```

They both share the same four ending 0s, but the private keys. Here are the respective private keys:

```
d36d062e9f3ed2957458f5ba400c868d072fad69e8bb3f24420669317bd908e5
33408b4122e6d3d7dba2104b1adee68cc5b96d81412aadad1af98203ea3b6218
```

Now take this public/private pair:
```
0x83eadc8f7fdf30b82f2c7b2493fe3b1baa22d9c8
e832f898c14f716e1c1c47f150140096ca7f04deac11a0c1b38139f9af0c143d
```

Metamask only show the first three letters and last four chars of the public url

If you wait long enough you can generate this pair that has the same prefix of length 3 and suffix of length 4:
```

```

You can also create custom ethereum addresses with cool prefixes:

```
leet: 0x1337642f7757b8cbcbd84dc44346d4e4291b3e58 / d6a9d5a05fa17ee0d3fd0e2119e89c5a3190cae1d1bdde3e2ad3418021b65e2d

420 69: 0x4206937ef998c8e11700d007cbcbec68150462c6 / 6efda672332dfc990a1549ba4508bf7158b708118bb08b58f3c410fce35933de
```

Note : using a suffix or prefix of cumulated length greater than 5 is really slow as the difficulty rises exponentially.
